*At the end of this post there is a poll. It asks, &#8220;Should I go to college?&#8221; If you have a moment, please answer either yes or no. Thank you.*

This August will be the first August that I am not going to school. At 20 years old I have never lived through a fall semester without going to mandatory classes of some sort.

I am an outlier. Nearly all of my peers are enrolled in either a two or four year university. Most everyone I know is ecstatic about returning to campus in the coming weeks.

Working full-time, commuting, and taking on more responsibility has made me feel older, wiser, and more experienced.

But, at what cost?

8 months have gone by since my decision to leave the University of Pittsburgh. I think now is a good time to reassess my situation and determine if I should plan a return back to school in the near future.

## About me

I am going to tell you a little about myself and where I am currently at in my life. I am going to tell you where I want to go, where I want to be, and who I want to become. Please let me know if going to college would be beneficial on this journey.

### Demographics

  * I am 20 years old.
  * I am a white man.
  * I have completed some college with no degree.
  * I am single.
  * I am employed.

### Academics

  * I scored a 1900 on my Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT).
  * I achieved a high school GPA of 3.6.
  * I enrolled in 10 Advanced Placement (AP) courses.
  * I was accepted to DePaul University, NorthEastern University, Drexel University, and the University of Pittsburgh. I did not get accepted to Villanova University.
  * I attended the University of Pittsburgh and had a GPA of 3.1.
  * I have 51 college credits.

## Present

Currently I work at a [start-up company][5] outside of Washington, D.C. My business card says, &#8220;web developer&#8221; on it. I write a lot of code, I learn a lot of best practices, and I dabble in design.

The CEO has a passion for teaching others. He mentors me. I have had one on one conversations with him about start-up financing, how to hire the right people, and how to build process. He has a passion for educating, and I am always a welcome audience. I am learning a lot from him.

The lead web developer has taught me how to be a professional. He has helped me learn to &#8220;slow down&#8221;, be more organized, and think more.

I work in an open office. I learn a lot from everyone &#8211; account managers, sales people, everyone.

## Future

I recently did an in depth goal setting session. I have [outlined goals for the next three years of my life][6]. Those goals align with who I want to be, where I want to be, and what I want to be doing in the future.

In the future I want to be in business. (In the present I want to be in business.) In the future I want to collaborate with others. I want to continue learning new things. I want to be fundamental in building something that is useful, effective, and provides value.

I know I am passionate for a lot of things. I want a shallow knowledge of a breadth of topics, with a deeper knowledge in only a few.

With this information in mind, should I go to college?
