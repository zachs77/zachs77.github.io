I have spent countless hours searching the web for tools, resources and books that every entrepreneur should consider using, reading and referencing. Whether you are a team of one, or a team of many, you will find this page useful.

This list has been broken down into stages of business development. At each stage there are 5 to 10 different tools, resources, and books that have been popular this year.

I have no affiliation with these companies and their products. Rather, I just like you, have found myself searching for these tools time and time again. I have simply taken the time to organize them all in a central location.

> If coming up with an idea for a startup equals coming up with a million dollar idea, then of course it&#8217;s going to seem hard. Too hard to bother trying. Our instincts tell us something so valuable would not be just lying around for anyone to discover.

-Paul Graham

#### <a href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html" target="_blank">HOW TO GET STARTUP IDEAS</a>
