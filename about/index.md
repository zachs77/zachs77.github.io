## My Story:

Currently I work at a start-up company outside of Washington, D.C. My business card says, “web developer” on it. I write a lot of code, I learn a lot of best practices, and I dabble in design.

The CEO has a passion for teaching others. He mentors me. I have had one on one conversations with him about start-up financing, how to hire the right people, and how to build process. He has a passion for educating, and I am always a welcome audience. I am learning a lot from him.

The lead web developer has taught me how to be a professional. He has helped me learn to “slow down”, be more organized, and think more.

I work in an open office. I learn a lot from everyone – account managers, sales people, everyone.

Before working full-time I was a student at the University of Pittsburgh. I dropped out after three semesters when my mom was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. I moved back home to live with my family.

While at Pitt I rarely focused on my studies. I was not binge drinking my days away, rather I was bouncing ideas off of my friends for startup companies and ways to make money. I have had a passion for entrepreneurship since I started my first “business” when I was a pre-teen in Arizona.

I have been making money online for 8 years now. This blog is a place where I share what I have learned, what I am doing, what I am learning, and other random business related thoughts.

**Welcome.**
