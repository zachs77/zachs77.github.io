<span class="mceItemHidden">In ten days I will turn 20 years old. And, as with every birthday, I will reflect on the year past.</span>

<span class="mceItemHidden">On my birthday I set aside time to think of goals that I would like to <span class="mceItemHidden">carry out</span> over the next 365 days. In the past, these objectives have ranged from personal to professional, entrepreneurial to academic.</span>

<span class="mceItemHidden">This year, unlike the 19 preceding ones, I intend to <span class="mceItemHidden">write down</span> my goals. As I have recently learned from a mentor, writing down your goals is a difficult but necessary step towards achieving them. Thinking about something you want to do is easy and pleasurable. Writing it down, although more difficult, makes that thought more concrete and feasible.</span>

## How to write goals

Fortunately for you and I, many smart men and women have figured out a fairly straightforward formula for goal setting. I&#8217;ll be sharing the techniques that I have recently been taught, but keep in mind there are plenty of other good resources for goal setting (I&#8217;ve listed some at the end of this post). The most important thing is that you go a step beyond *thinking*<span class="mceItemHidden"> about your goals and <span class="mceItemHidden">take the time</span> to </span>**write them down**.

Here is the 5 step process I have adopted and use for my personal goal setting.

  1. Visualize your life 3 years from now, 1 year from now, 90 days from now. Write a short paragraph about where you are, what you are doing, what a typical day in your life is like. Describe what you see and feel.
  2. <span class="mceItemHidden">Take your 3 year visualization, 1 year visualization, and 90 day visualization to build goals. Write an affirmative, present tense, quantifiable, and specific sentence (or two) that correlates with the short paragraph you have already written. Start with your 3 year goals, then 1 year and 90 days. A 3 year goal should <span class="mceItemHidden">build on</span> a 1 year goal which should then relate to a 90 day goal. Write down 3-6 objectives for each time frame.</span>
  3. <span class="mceItemHidden">Write down why you want to <span class="mceItemHidden">achieve</span> the goals you have outlined above. Do this for every 90 day goal, 1 year goal, and 3 year goal. What benefit will be achieved?</span>
  4. In a few brief sentences describe what achievement will look like. How will you know you have hit your goal? Again, do this for every time period.
  5. <span class="mceItemHidden">Create a list of steps required to <span class="mceItemHidden">meet</span> your goal. What is the deadline for each step? Do this for every 90 day goal, 1 year goal and 3 year goal.</span>

<span class="mceItemHidden">You will now have an outline for how you can <span class="mceItemHidden">achieve</span> your goals.</span>

<span class="mceItemHidden">Writing down these goals, and the steps that you plan to take <span class="mceItemHidden">to</span> meet them is surprisingly challenging. Yet, it is by writing your goals down that the next step, actually implementing them into your life is made easier.</span>

<span class="mceItemHidden">By planing and attaching deadlines to specific actions you will find yourself more dedicated and focused while being less stressed and worried. Going beyond thinking about goals is not easy, yet the <span class="mceItemHidden">long-term </span>reward is well worth the struggle.</span>
